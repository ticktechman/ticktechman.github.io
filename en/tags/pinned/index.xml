      <description>Some days ago, I setup this blog website with hugo and tailwindcss. And all code written from scratch.&#xA;1. Why build it myself?&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s only one reason: to have full control over all the content, unaffected by any platform, solely based on personal preferences. It only requires a bit of hands-on capability. And you can DIY your own system too.&#xA;2. Why start blogging?&#xA;My thoughts have always been somewhat scattered, and I wanted to use writing as a means to record and organize them, while also documenting some content that might be reused in the future for my own reference.</description>
